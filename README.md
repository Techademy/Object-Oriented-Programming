======================

Please note: This codebase is very old. Most of the code in this codebase is in no way good or following best practices.

Your assignment for today: Refactor (parts of) this to be more Object Oriented. Send pull requests with changes, so we can discuss the changes. Almost *any* change is an improvement, so don't be scared to send pull requests ;)
