(1, 'Tolkien', 'Born John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, on January 3, 1892, as the son of English-born parents in Bloemfontein, in the Orange Free State of South Africa, where his father worked as a bank manager. To escape the heat and dust of southern Africa and to better guard the delicate health of Ronald (as he was called), Tolkien''s mother moved back to England with him and his younger brother when they were very young boys. \r\nWithin a year of this move their father, Arthur Tolkien, died in Bloemfontein, and a few years later the boys'' mother died as well. The boys lodged at several homes from 1905 until 1911, when Ronald entered Exeter College, Oxford. Tolkien received his B.A. from Oxford in 1915 and an M.A. in 1919. During the interim, he married his longtime sweetheart, Edith Bratt, and served for a short time on the Western Front with the Lancashire Fusiliers. The couple eventually had four children.\r\n\r\nWhile in England recovering from "trench fever" in 1917, Tolkien began writing "The Book of Lost Tales," which eventually became The Silmarillion (1977) and laid the groundwork for his stories about Middle-earth. After the Armistice he returned to Oxford, where he joined the staff of The Oxford English Dictionary and began work as a freelance tutor. In 1920, he was appointed Reader in English Language at Leeds University, where he collaborated with E. V. Gordon on an acclaimed translation of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, which was completed and published in 1925. (Some years later, Tolkien completed a second translation of this poem, which was published posthumously.)\r\n\r\nThe following year, having returned to Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, Tolkien became friends with a fellow of Magdalen College, C. S. Lewis. They shared an intense enthusiasm for the myths, sagas, and languages of northern Europe; and to better enhance those interests, both attended meetings of "The Coalbiters," an Oxford club, founded by Tolkien, at which Icelandic sagas were read aloud. \r\n\r\nDuring the rest of his years at Oxford—20 as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, 14 as Merton Professor of English Language and Literature—Tolkien published several esteemed short studies and translations. Notable among these are his essays "Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics" (1936), "Chaucer as a Philologist: The Reeve''s Tale" (1934), and "On Fairy-Stories" (1947); his scholarly edition of Ancrene Wisse (1962); and his translations of three medieval poems: "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight," "Pearl," and "Sir Orfeo" (1975).\r\n\r\nAs a writer of imaginative literature, though, Tolkien is best known for The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, tales which were formed during his years attending meetings of "The Inklings," an informal gathering of like-minded friends and fellow dons, initiated after the demise of The Coalbiters. The Inklings, which was formed during the late 1930s and lasted until the late 1940s, was a weekly meeting held in Lewis''s sitting-room at Magdalen, at which works-in-progress were read aloud and discussed and critiqued by the attendees, all interspersed with free-flowing conversation about literature and other topics. The nucleus of the group was Tolkien, Lewis, and Lewis''s friend, novelist Charles Williams; other participants, who attended irregularly, included Lewis''s brother Warren, Nevill Coghill, H. V. D. Dyson, Owen Barfield, and others. The common thread that bound them was that they were all adherents of Christianity and all had a love of story. Having heard Tolkien''s first hobbit story read aloud at a meeting of the Inklings, Lewis urged Tolkien to publish The Hobbit, which appeared in 1937. A major portion of The Fellowship of the Ring, the first book in the trilogy, was also read to The Inklings before the group disbanded in the late 1940''s. \r\n\r\nTolkien retired from his professorship in 1959. While the unauthorized publication of an American edition of The Lord of the Rings in 1965 angered him, it also made him a widely admired cult figure in the United States, especially among high school and college students. Uncomfortable with this status, he and his wife lived quietly in Bournemouth for several years, until Edith''s death in 1971. In the remaining two years of his life, Tolkien returned to Oxford, where he was made an honorary fellow of Merton College and awarded a doctorate of letters. He was at the height of his fame as a scholarly and imaginative writer when he died in 1973, though critical study of his fiction continues and has increased in the years since. \r\n\r\nThe continuing popularity of Tolkien’s work, especially The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings evidences his ability to evoke the oppressive realities of modern life while drawing audiences into a fantasy world.\r\n', 1, 1, 1, '', 'J.

(2, 'Salvatore', 'Bob Salvatore was born in Massachusetts in 1959. His love affair with fantasy, and with literature in general, began during his sophomore year of college when he was given a copy of J.R.R. Tolkien''s The Lord of the Rings as a Christmas gift. He promptly changed his major from computerscience to journalism. He received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Communications from Fitchburg State College in 1981, then returned for the degree he always cherished, the Bachelor of Arts in English. He began writing seriously in 1982, penning the manuscript that would become Echoes of the Fourth Magic.\r\nHis first published novel was The Crystal Shard from TSR in 1988. Since that time, Bob has published numerous novels, including the New York Times Bestselling The Halfling''s Gem, Sojourn, and The Legacy, the first hardcover for Bob and for TSR. Bob held many jobs during those first years as a writer, finally settling in (much to our delight) to write full time in 1990. R.A. Salvatore is best known as the creator of the dark elf Drizzt, one of the fantasy genre''s most beloved characters. Over three million R.A. Salvatore novels have been sold with many translated into different languages and audio versions.\r\n\r\nHis previously published TSR novels include The Icewind Dale Trilogy, The Dark Elf Trilogy, and The Cleric Quintet, as well as The Legacy, Starless Night, Siege of Darkness and Passage to Dawn. The Dark Elf Trilogy is now available in a hardcover collector''s edition. The Silent Blade is his sixteenth original novel for TSR. In the fall of 1997, Bob''s letters, manuscripts, and other professional papers were donated to the R.A. Salvatore Library at his alma mater, Fitchburg State College in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. When he isn''t writing, Bob attends his three children''s hockey games, horse shows, and fencing events. His gaming group of 18 years still meets on Sundays to play everything from Nintendo 64 Goldeneye to the AD&D game. Together they recently wrote The Accursed Tower, a Forgotten Realms game module set in Icewind Dale, due out from TSR in 1999. His hobbies include softball, hockey, and music, particularly a good blast of Mozart while tooling down the highway.

The books won numerous awards and accolades, including Canada''s Casper Award for Best Novel in the fantasy genre in 1986 and Kay''s nomination for the John W. Campbell Award as best new writer in the genre.\r\n\r\nPrior to writing this epic trilogy, Kay was retained by the Estate of J. R. R. Tolkien at Oxford in 1974-5 to assist Christopher Tolkien in the editorial construction of the unfinished, posthumously published, The Silmarillion. He studied law and was called to the Bar in 1982, but decided not to practise.

His writings have sold millions of copies worldwide, in over a dozen languages. He has been a Guest of Honour at over two dozen conventions, from Stockholm, Sweden to Melbourne, Australia (often appearing in costume as Elminster the Sage), and has been editor, co-editor, or contributing editor of the yearbook Orbit, the literary magazines IBID and White Wall Review, and DRAGON® Magazine. \r\n\r\nEd has been a columnist for The Campaign Hack (Canada''s longest-running gaming magazine), the independent gaming magazine Cryptych, and POLYHEDRON¨® Newszine, published by the Role-Playing Gamers'' Association® (of which he is a Charter Lifetime Member).

DRAGON® Magazine readers eagerly await each new (irregular) installment of two popular Ed Greenwood series: "Pages From The Mages" and "The Wizards Three," and his monthly columns, "The New Adventures of Volo," which recently succeeded his long-running "Wyrms of the North." His series detailing The Nine Hells (issues #75, 76, and 91) were the most popular DRAGON® Magazine articles of all time; the issues containing them (and #62, which contained his first "Pages" article) command premium prices at collectors'' auctions. Ed had three pieces in the anniversary issue #200 of DRAGON®, more than any other author, and has published over two hundred articles and short stories in its pages. He co-produced the popular "Elminster''s Notebook" DRAGON® column with artist Gary Williams. \r\n\r\nEd has been writing about the Realms since the winter of 1967-68.

(11, 'Abbey', 'I was born in New York''s Hudson River Valley, in the city of Peekskill, during the so-called "baby boom". Peekskill is also the birthplace of Mel Gibson, PeeWee Herman, and one of the first nuclear reactors in the US. The Gibsons moved to Australia shortly after Mel was born. PeeWee and I just kept on drinking that supercharged water. \r\n\r\nYou may draw your own conclusions from this. \r\n\r\nFamily legends confirm that I''ve been a storyteller pretty much from the moment I learned to talk. I quickly learned that character, pacing and plot were important to any work of fiction, but that nothing was more important than believability. Parents cannot be convinced that there are monsters under the bed, but they will spend hours looking for mice or squirrels. \r\n\r\nI discovered my father''s typewriter long before I learned to read and decided that any machine which had so many moving parts and made such amazing noises was going to be a major part of my life. I''ve been an only child most of my life and filled my world with imaginary friends. \r\n\r\nI didn''t play with them. \r\n\r\nI watched them play with each other, then I wrote about them. I kept this up until I got to college, the University of Rochester, class of 1969, where the real world was, at long last, more interesting than anything I could imagine. At first I majored in hard science- astrophysics- but migrated to the humanities because they understood that life did not begin until noon and never scheduled 8AM organic chemistry labs. I''d gotten two degrees in European history and was well on my way to my Ph.D. when my advisor pointed out that, given the natural rise and fall of demographic curves, tenured university faculty positions were going to be as scarce as hen''s teeth for the next twenty-five years and my education was turning into an expensive hobby. (He was right, too.) \r\n\r\nHe suggested I get myself a real job, so I became a computer programmer, which in those days (after dinosaurs, before IBM 360''s) was a wide-open hands-on field. Companies were eagerly hiring warm bodies to computerize decades, even centuries, of handwritten data. \r\n\r\nI vanished into the dusty archives of a huge insurance company and might have remained there forever, but fate - masquerading as the New York City Bankruptcy Crisis of 1976 - intervened. The powers that were, in recognition for my tolerance of dust, silverfish, and the occasional mouse, made me the least significant member of the state taskforce charged with deciphering the city''s arcane pension funds. My job: take a forklift full of key- punched cards (representing a quarter century of police, fire, and sanitation force records which had been stashed in leaky closets all over City Hal) and load them onto "modern" magnetic tape! (Deleting, of course, the ones the mice, roaches, and whatnot had mangled beyond all electronic interpretation.) When I was finished, senior members of the task force would prove actuarially what everyone already knew intuitively: there was no earthly way New York City could meet its obligations. \r\n\r\nThroughout that long winter and spring, while decoding one ancient algorithm after another, I contemplated life in the Big Apple without police, without firefighters and, especially, without garbage collection. The state did eventually decide to bail the city out; I decided to bail out of the city. \r\n\r\nI headed west. I got to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where bagels were fresh, lox was airlifted daily, and the sky was frequently blue and rarely green. \r\n\r\nStill, it took one more major turn of events to get me back to my childhood dreams. In January of 1977 I headed for the airport to fetch Gordon Dickson back to Ann Arbor for the annual science fiction convention. (My Ann Arbor acquaintances being old-time SF readers and convention-goers.) The temperature hadn''t seen the plus side of zero degrees Fahrenheit for a week and the brake cylinders on my old New York car finally said "enough." They gave up the ghost on the airport access road. I came to in an emergency room. The less said about the balance of that afternoon, the better. \r\n\r\nExcept that Gordie felt guilty: Someone he didn''t know from Adam had very nearly made the ultimate sacrifice to get him to the convention on time. I guess he felt a karmic need to make a sacrifice in return: He offered to read such prose as I could manage to produce. It was an offer that I could not refuse. Propped up by pillows and crutches, and still suffering the hallucinations of a fractured skull, I began Daughter of the Bright Moon. \r\n\r\nPoor Gordie. He later confessed that I was, beyond doubt, the least-promising would-be writer ever to cross his bows. He swears he did his best to discourage me, and that he wasn''t at all subtle, but I never got the message. I''d been given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become what I''d always dreamed of being and a simple thing like a style charitably described as "academically turgid" wasn''t going to get in my way. \r\n\r\nFortunately for me, by the time I was rid of my crutches and Gordie might have considered his karmic debt fully repaid, with interest, I''d taken his blunt lessons to heart and tried to incorporate them into Daughter. Gordie sat back after what must have been the ninth or tenth rewrite of chapter one and said, with a look of astonishment, that it was good and I should start chapter two. \r\n\r\nThe rest, one might say, is history. A year after my accident, with Daughter finished but advisedly left behind, Gordie squired me through the editorial gauntlet at the 1978 Boscon. I was initiated into the ranks of soon-to-be-published writers and never looked back. \r\n\r\nThere''ve been many ups and downs since 1978. Any creative lifestyle can be categorized as "life without any visible means of support". I married Bob Asprin and spent most of the 1980''s as a step-mother, a role which, especially for a fantasy writer, comes with a whole lot of emotional baggage. Since I started, I''ve written thirteen novels. I also wrote for and eventually wound up co-editing the Thieves'' World shared-world anthology series which ran for twelve volumes before going on hiatus. Courtesy of TW, I''ve been invited into other shared-world anthologies, often in exchange for the "inside scoop" on how I handled story continuity, not to mention egos and deadlines. \r\n\r\nIn 1993, during the throes of a prolonged but ultimately amicable divorce from Bob, C.J. Cherryh suggested that when the dust cleared I might relocate to Oklahoma City (where the locals had a lot of experience with dust and which, she assured me, was not outside the known universe). I first crossed the Mississippi with great trepidation, expecting all my Hudson River-based mitochondria to rise up in revolt, but they adapted to the change in water and I made the move in January of 1994, when, for the first time since 1977, we went two weeks without seeing the plus side of zero on the thermometer. But negative numbers seemed felicitous for me. \r\n\r\nBENEATH THE WEB, the sequel to the Wooden Sword was well-received when it was published in August of 1994. My second DarkSun novel, Cinnabar Shadows was published by TSR in July of 1995. I thought things were looking up, but I forgot that while fiction, even fantasy fiction, must be more believable than fact, the business of fiction knows no limit to the word "strange". Although ACE Books bought my trilogy, Siege of Shadows, they opted to publish only one volume of it in 1996, a decision which led them to re-consider our long-term relationship and me to consider a lot more than that. \r\n\r\nI''ve continued writing for TSR since its acquisition by Wizards of the Coast; producing pulp fiction is an honorable trade and the place where many lifelong readers get their start. I''ve also joined forces with a new publisher, DAW Books, where the editors seem to like the very aspects of my fiction, which irritated ACE so much. My first DAW Book, Jerlayne, hit the stands in March 1999; I''m hoping it''s the first of many. I''m still working with ACE, though "another example of hope trumping experience"? and will have a series of "modern-day witchcraft with historical overtones" coming out from them starting in 2000. \r\n\r\nWith all those changes, it seemed time to leave Oklahoma, too. My sense of direction still leaves something to be desired. In 1997, I got my mitochondria back to the eastern side of the Mississippi, but I turned right instead of left in Memphis and wound up in central Florida where the temperatures rarely dip below freezing. I''ve adapted, though; I leave my windows open in December and sometimes it almost feels like winter. My computer takes up a good chunk of the living room; embroidery and books fill the rest. My cat is happy. What more could a writer want? \r\n \r\n', 1, 1, 0, '', 'Lynn'),

(17, 'Reid', 'Thomas was born to Norma and Tony Reid in a snowstorm in the mountains of Fort Collins, Colorado, two days before the Christmas of 1966. It''s pretty much an accepted certainty that he learned to be a Dallas Cowboy fan in the womb, and this theory is substantiated by the fact that, at six days of age, he took his first airplane ride to Texas, where cousins waving Cowboys- Packers playoff tickets before Superbowl I met his parents at the gate. He spent the first two years of his life living in Colorado and Virginia before the family moved back to Texas. \r\n\r\nGrowing up in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, Thomas quickly learned to love the Texas Rangers, pan-fried catfish & Tex-Mex, 110- degree weather, cats, and Johnson grass, and to hate poison ivy, fire ants, tornadoes, boiled okra & fried chicken livers, and having more Yankee fans than Ranger fans at the home games. At the age of almost four, he became a professional hermit in order to hide from his newborn sister, Juliana. Thomas whiled away his youth with his best friends Steve Walton, Jerry Smiley, David Swindel and Al Martin, playing Dungeons & Dragons, hanging out at Six Flags Amusement Park, camping, talking sports, or driving his parents'' 1953 Wyllis Jeep into the mud, unless his parents made him clean out the garage and mow the grass, of course. \r\n\r\nIn high school, Thomas performed with the marching, jazz, and symphonic bands, and he once ran over his own trombone with his car. The biggest thrill of his band days was winning the UT Arlington Jazz Festival and being invited to perform at, and attending, the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland in the summer of 1983. Thomas graduated high school in 1985, convinced he was going to be a civil engineer. \r\n\r\nAfter a year at the University of Houston, Thomas returned to the DFW area and changed his major to Liberal Arts. There he spent some of his happiest days, attending college at UT Arlington and playing D&D with all his old friends, whose characters explored the Temple of Elemental Evil together. Eventually, he found his way to Austin, where he met his wife Teresa (while gaming!) and got a B.A. in History from the University of Texas in 1989. \r\n\r\nRight after graduating, Thomas made a living in various odd capacities (like selling books and building wooden swing sets in Texas and doing statistical analysis for studies on the elderly in Indiana), just like every other well-paid history major. Then, one fateful day, Thomas answered a TSR advertisement in the back of Dragon Magazine seeking professional editors. Being hired by the company that produced his favorite game was akin to becoming a professional baseball player or an astronaut, in his mind, so he and Teresa moved to Delavan, Wisconsin in the fall of 1991. \r\n\r\nThomas lived in Wisconsin for nearly six years, working initially as an editor and eventually being promoted to Creative Director at TSR, Inc. While living in the dairy state, Teresa gave birth to two terrific sons, Aidan and Galen, and the family bought their very first house. When Wizards of the Coast purchased the company and relocated everyone to Washington, the Reid family packed up their van and headed west. \r\n\r\nToday, Thomas lives in the greater Seattle area with his beautiful wife and kids, along with two cats named Mystra and Selune, in a nice, cozy house with a great view of Mount Rainier. He''s returned to the creative side of things and currently works in the Special Projects Group within RPG R&D at Wizards. Some of his editing and design projects that are personal favorites include Dragon Mountain, a trilogy of beholder adventures, Tale of the Comet, and the lovely golem Angelique in Children of the Night: The Created. In addition to gaming material, Thomas has written a handful of Dragon Magazine articles and a pair of short stories that appear in Forgotten Realms anthologies, and his first novel should see print sometime in 2000. \r\n\r\nWhen he''s not working, Thomas loves to go hiking and camping, play with his kids, and root for the Rangers, Cowboys, Stars, and Texas Longhorns. He also loves to play softball, indoor soccer, touch football, basketball, tennis, and golf in the daytime, and to game, read, write, and paint miniatures after dark. Unless he has to clean out the garage or mow the grass, of course. \r\n\r\n', 1, 1, 0, '', 'Thomas M.'),

In fact, that is typical of the humility and modesty that are the trademarks of this exceptionally talented author who is remarkable in just about every respect. Another example: he graciously pays his own tab at Alliterates meetings, even though the other members would be more than willing to cover his expenses merely in exchange for the pleasure of his scintillating conversation and rapier-like wit.\r\n\r\nNiles is the kind of writer who likes extra cheese on his pizza. As the most mature of the Alliterates, he has tried to set an example for the younger fellows, frequently drawing on his long years of life experiences. For example, the beer glass (frosted, of course) is to be canted at a slight angle while the amber beverage is poured gently down the inclined interior surface. The other members of the group, unfortunately, are not always apt pupils -- indeed, Niles has lost count of the times that this particular lesson has needed to be repeated.\r\n\r\nA former high school teacher, Doug Niles left that profession in 1982 to begin designing adventure games. His designs have won the prestigious HG Wells and Origins awards in multiple categories, and include dozens of military simulations, miniatures rules, and role-playing games. His favorite works include the huge ETO/PTO game (an operational/strategic simulation of World War II) and Red Storm Rising, a game based on the best-selling Tom Clancy novel. He has also written more products than any other designer for the tremendously successful Dragonlance game series from TSR Inc.\r\n\r\nBut his real love is telling stories, and during his years at TSR he found the opportunity to start writing novels. In 1990 that became his full-time profession, one he sincerely hopes will keep him busy well into the next century. His twenty-five published novels include the Watershed trilogy (from Ace fantasy), the Moonshae trilogy, and many Dragonlance novels (from TSR, Inc). Co-authoring with Michael Dobson, he has just finished up an epic novel of WW2 alternate history called Fox on the Rhine. That book is due to be published next year, in hardcover, by TOR.\r\n\r\nHe is the only Alliterate who is a lifelong Wisconsin resident (though perhaps it should be noted that Steve''s only geographical shortcoming was being born on the wrong bank of the Mississippi River).

I swear there is no connection. \r\n\r\nThough I was born in Georgia, most of my life has been spent in Virginia. In fifth grade a friend introduced me to a certain TV show then in reruns called Star Trek, thus beginning my love affair with speculative fiction. I attended Washington-Lee High school (a year ahead of actress Sandra Bullock-Sandy, if you''re reading this, call my agent) and was fortunate enough to have several teachers who encouraged my, er, "habit". I began my first novel, an epic fantasy, when I was sixteen. \r\n\r\nIt never saw publication, but two books set in that world did: Instrument of Fate (Ace Books, 1996), which made it onto the Nebula Award preliminary ballot, and King''s Man & Thief (Ace Books, 1997). I linked up with TSR when they were auditioning for authors and kicked off their Ravenloft line with Vampire of the Mists in 1991. I followed that up with Dance of the Dead in ''92 and The Enemy Within in ''94. It is a sad but true fact that due to deadline pressures I was writing parts of Enemy while on my honeymoon in Antigua. Nothing like trying to write a horror novel while sitting on white sands beneath swaying palms. Still, I managed. \r\n\r\nAlong about this time, my love affair with Star Trek was consummated; I wrote a Voyager novel called The Murdered Sun. I must have done something right, because I was invited to pitch scripts for the show. I met Jeri Taylor and got to tour the set -- quite a thrill for a long-time fan. \r\n\r\nThe Murdered Sun came out in 1996, the same year as Instrument, and in 1998 I had another two-fer, with the publication of King''s Man and a second Trek novel, Marooned. Scattered throughout this timeline are over a dozen short stories in various anthologies. \r\n\r\n1998 and ''99 saw a couple of major projects for DreamWorks SKG and Roc Books. The novelization of the animated television show, Invasion America, and its prequel, an original book called On the Run, impressed producer Harve Bennett sufficiently that he invited me to come out and work on the show. Unfortunately, Invasion America was not renewed. \r\n\r\nLater this year, look for a collaboration with Michael Jan Friedman, a Star Trek novel, Double Helix #6: The First Virtue. \r\n\r\nIn November, I''ll have a new fantasy novel out under the pen name of Jadrien Bell. It''s a major work called A.D. 999, a nice, big historical novel with all kinds of mythic overtones. I know you''ll like it! \r\n\r\nI now live in Colorado, with my husband, our white German Shepherd, and two cats, including one who fetches bottle caps, but that would be a whole other bio. \r\n\r\n', 1, 1, 0, 'christiegolden.jpg', 'Christie'),

Kenney had previously collaborated with Beard at the Harvard Lampoon where the pair had been at the head of the young newcomers who had infused new life into the then stagnant college humor magazine.\r\n\r\nThough he had been a social climber at Harvard, at NatLamp he seemed to identify more with the counterculture. According to Hendra (in "Going Too Far"), Kenney objected when art director Michael Gross was brought in to overhaul the magazine''s unkempt design, as he felt the new look was too "establishment" for his taste. After seeing what Gross could do, he changed his mind. In the end, Kenney probably benefitted more than anyone from Gross''s talent for imitating virtually any graphic style. Later, Kenney would tell people that he and Gross "invented" nostalgia.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Kenney is best known for his "nostalgia" pieces--teen anxiety in middle-class America was a common theme--culminating with the "1964 High School Yearbook Parody" in 1974 (co-edited by P. J. O''Rourke).\r\n\r\nKenney was also responsible for "Mrs. Agnew''s Diary," a regular department that lampooned the Nixon administration. Written in the breathless style of a suburban housewife''s diary, it chronicles her life with "Spiggy" and the Nixons, oblivious to the shady political games being played by those around her.\r\n\r\nBeard, Kenney, and Hoffmann had a 5-year buyout clause in their contract with NatLamp''s publisher, 21st Century Communications. The three excercised the option when the time came in 1974, to the tune of $7-million divided among them. Beard left as soon as the contract was settled; Hoffmann had left 1971 to finish graduate school.Kenney stayed on until 1977, when he wrote the screenplay for Animal House (with Chris Miller and Harold Ramis), the highest box-office comedy ever made. \r\n\r\nKenney went on to write Caddyshack.

The first two books in the Hitchhiker series were adapted into a 6 part television series, which was an immediate success when first aired in 1982. Other publications include Dirk Gently''s Holistic Detective Agency (1987) and Long Dark Tea-time of the Soul (1988). In 1984 Douglas teamed up with John Lloyd and wrote The Meaning of Liff and after a huge success The Deeper Meaning of Liff followed this in 1990).

My stories come out of my characters; how those characters would react to the given situation. Maybe that''s why I get letters from readers as young as thirteen and as old as sixty-odd. One of the reasons I write song lyrics is because I see songs as a kind of `story pill'' -- they reduce a story to the barest essentials or encapsulate a particular crucial moment in time. I frequently will write a lyric when I am attempting to get to the heart of a crucial scene; I find that when I have done so, the scene has become absolutely clear in my mind, and I can write exactly what I wanted to say. Another reason is because of the kind of novels I am writing: that is, fantasy, set in an other-world semi-medieval atmosphere. Music is very important to medieval peoples; bards are the chief newsbringers. When I write the `folk music'' of these peoples, I am enriching my whole world, whether I actually use the song in the text or not. \r\n\r\n''I began writing out of boredom; I continue out of addiction. I can''t `not'' write, and as a result I have no social life! I began writing fantasy because I love it, but I try to construct my fantasy worlds with all the care of a `high-tech'' science fiction writer. I apply the principle of TANSTAAFL [`There ain''t no such thing as free lunch'', credited to Robert Heinlein) to magic, for instance; in my worlds, magic is paid for, and the cost to the magician is frequently a high one. I try to keep my world as solid and real as possible; people deal with stubborn pumps, bugs in the porridge, and love-lives that refuse to become untangled, right along with invading armies and evil magicians. And I try to make all of my characters, even the `evil magicians,'' something more than flat stereotypes. Even evil magicians get up in the night and look for cookies, sometimes. \r\n\r\n''I suppose that in everything I write I try to expound the creed I gave my character Diana Tregarde in Burning Water: \r\n\r\nThere''s no such thing as `one, true way''; the only answers worth having are the ones you find for yourself; leave the world better than you found it. Love, freedom, and the chance to do some good -- they''re the things worth living and dying for, and if you aren''t willing to die for the things worth living for, you might as well turn in your membership in the human race.'' \r\n\r\n[Biography care of DragonCon 2003 Website: http://www.dragoncon.org/people/lackeym.html ]', 1, 49, 1, '', 'Mercedes'),

Although he spent most of his childhood and young adult years in the Denver area, avidly reading fantasy and science fiction, he never attended any science fiction conventions -- in Denver or elsewhere, but he does remember reading Vance Aandahl''s stories in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction with considerable envy, since he and Vance were near contemporaries. Mr. Modesitt graduated from Williams College under the delusion that poetry was considered respectable and that fantasy and science fiction were not, a mistake he now attributes to youthful enthusiasm. \r\nHe has been a delivery boy; a lifeguard; an unpaid radio disc jockey; a U.S. Navy pilot; a market research analyst; a real estate agent; director of research for a political campaign; legislative assistant and staff director for a U.S. Congressman; Director ofLegislation and Congressional Relations for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; a consultant on environmental, regulatory, and communications issues; and a college lecturer and writer in residence. In addition to his novels, Mr. Modesitt has published technical studies and articles (generally with boring titles), columns, poetry, and a number of science fiction stories. \r\n\r\nShortly after his tours as a Navy amphious officer and than as a pilot, he returned to Denver as a market research analyst and economist, which generated the idea for his first story -- "The Great American Economy" -- published in ANALOG in 1973. He remained oblivious to the existence of fandom and conventions, and pursued a career in another type of fantasy by becoming legislative assistant for Congressman Bill Armstrong in Washington, D.C. During his years in Washington, he attempted to regain some hold on reality by writing increasingly more science fiction. Not totally by coincidence, his first novel was published while he was serving as head of Legislation and Congressional Relations at the U.S. EPA during the Reagan-Burford scandals. There he was responsible for responding to Congressional investigations and hearings and accepting midnight telephone calls from various individuals terming themselves journalists. This experience led to the writing of The Green Progression, a book termed more fantastic than any of his fantasy novels. Such public and critical reaction confirmed his fundamental belief in the reality of science fiction and fantasy. \r\n\r\nAfter departing EPA and while working as a regulatory consultant, his editor enlightened him as to the importance and role of fans and conventions and shanghaied him to his first convention at the age of 42. Shortly thereafter, his writing increased, and his consulting decreased, and he has been attending and participating in conventions ever since. \r\n\r\nAlong the way, Mr. Modesitt has weathered eight children, a fondness for three-piece suits [which has deteriorated into a love of vests], a brown labrador, a white cockapoo, an energetic Shihtzu, a Siamese rabbit, and various assorted pet rodents. Finally, in 1989, to escape nearly twenty years of occupational captivity in Washington, D.C., he moved to New Hampshire. There he married a lyric soprano, and he and his wife Carol moved to Cedar City, Utah, in 1993, where she directs the opera program at Southern Utah University and he continues to create and manage chaos. \r\n\r\nAlthough he is possibly best known for his "Recluce" fantasy saga, with over a million books in print, he continues to write science fiction as well, and has been known to twist the arms of booksellers [most tactfully and gently] to encourage them to backlist his titles other than fantasy. \r\n', 1, 62, 1, '', 'L.E.'),

At that time she quit her job in order to find \\''more suitable work\\''.\r\n\r\nThree months later she still hadn\\''t found a new job that suited her. About that time she got an idea for a short story about a prehistoric girl. According to Jean, \\"The \\''short story\\'' led me to do some research; the research fired my imagination, and the wealth of material made me decide to write a novel. The first draft turned out to be more than 450,000 words and fell into six parts. On rewriting, I realized each of these six parts was a novel in itself. I have used that rough draft as the outline for the series.\\"\r\n\r\nShe proceeded with work on the first novel. She rewrote the whole thing four times and some parts twenty to thirty times until she was satisfied with the end result. This was in September 1978. She had a hard time finding a publisher to take on the series, given the large task ahead - with five more novels pending. In September 1980 when The Clan of the Cave Bear finally saw the light of day it was an instant success. Within a month more than 100,000 copies sold, after which it was on the best-seller lists for eight more months.\r\n\r\nThe story takes place around 35,000 to 25,000 years ago in the late pleistocene epoch (the Ice Age) in prehistoric Europe. It is about a Cro-Magnon girl named Ayla and her interaction with Neandertals, her environment, and finally with other Cro-Magnon people.\r\n\r\nJean\\''s extensive research has taken her to prehistoric sites in France, Austria, Czechoslovakia, the Ukraine, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Germany (to follow a portion of the Danube for the 4th novel).\r\n\r\nShe has learned, through various sources, how to knapp flint, construct snow caves, tan hides, gather and prepare wild foods, medicinal plants and herbs. She worked with the Malheur Field Station in the high desert steppe country of central Oregon and took Aboriginal Life Skills classes from anthropologist and instructor, Jim Riggs. Jim taught her how a fire is made, how a spear-thrower is used, how bulrushes make sleeping mats, how to pressure-flake a stone tool, and how to squish deer brains to turn deer hide into velvety soft leather. She worked with professionals in many different fields and countries to gain firsthand knowledge of recent discoveries and new theories. In 1990, after Plains of Passage was published, Waldenbooks interviewed her in France, where she had gone to study Cro-Magnon painted caves - research for the fifth book. \r\n\r\n\\"These people were the first modern humans. It\\''s fairly well accepted by most of the archaeological community that they had the same range of intelligence and the same psychological and emotional reactions as we have, except that theirs were directed in different ways.

What I was trying to show is that just because prehistory seemed to be a \\''simpler time\\'', that doesn\\''t mean that prehistoric man did not need a great deal of intelligence, knowledge and wisdom to survive.\\" \r\n\r\nFuture plans: \\"I\\''ve been working 17 years on this project, and I want to do something else--maybe a mystery, or a thin little literary science fiction book, or something.

(144, 'Jacques', 'Brian Jacques (pronounced "jakes") was born in Liverpool, England on June 15th, 1939. Along with forty percent of the population of Liverpool, his ancestral roots are in Ireland, County Cork to be exact.\r\nHe grew up in the area around the Liverpool docks. His interest in adventure stories began at an early age with reading the books of:\r\n\r\nDaniel Defoe \r\nSir Henry Rider Haggard \r\nArthur Conan Doyle \r\nSir Thomas Malory \r\nRobert Michael Ballantyne \r\nRobert Louis Stevenson\r\nEdgar Rice Burroughs \r\nKenneth Grahame\r\nHe attended St. John''s School, an inner city school that had its playground on the roof. On his first day at St. John''s, at the age of ten, he had an experience that marked his potential as a writer. When given an assignment of writing a story about animals, he wrote about the bird that cleaned a crocodile''s teeth. The teacher could not, and would not believe that a ten year old could write that well. When young Brian refused to falsely say that he had copied the story, he was caned as "a liar". He had always loved to write, but it was only then, that he realized that he had a talent for writing.\r\n\r\nSome teachers at St. John''s proved to be good role models. As Mr. Jacques recalls:\r\n\r\n\r\n"My favourite teacher was Mr. Austin Thomas. He looked like Lee Marvin. Big Man. A Captain in World War II. He came to school on a big bush bike with the haversack on back. He was a man''s man. Always fair. I was fourteen at the time when Mr. Thomas introduced the class to poetry and Greek literature. (Because of him, I saved seven shillings and sixpence to buy The Iliad and The Odyssey at this dusty used book shop.)"\r\nThis interest in poetry extended to Wordsworth, Tennyson, and Goldsmith.\r\nIt was also at St. John''s that Brian met a teacher, Alan Durband (who also taught two Beatles, Paul McCartney and George Harrison), who, more than thirty years later would bring about a major change in his life. \r\n\r\nAfter Brian finished school at fifteen, he set out to find adventure as a merchant seaman. He travelled to many far away ports, including New York, Valparaiso, San Francisco, and Yokohama. Tiring of the lonely life of a sailor, he returned to Liverpool where he worked as a railway fireman, a longshoreman, a long-distance truck driver, a bus driver, a boxer, a bobby (Police Constable 216D), a postmaster, and a stand-up comic.\r\n\r\nDuring the sixties, when the Beatles put the world spotlight on Liverpool, he and six others including his two brothers, formed a folksinging group known as The Liverpool Fishermen. Both his brothers emigrated to New Zealand. His older brother, Tony, a carpenter, lived there with his children and grandchildren, until 1998 when he passed away. His younger brother, Jimmy, returned to Britain after twelve years. He is a prison officer in Lancaster, is married to Sandra, and has twin sons, Paul and Sean, age 19.\r\n\r\nMr. Jacques has written both poetry and music, but he began his writing career in earnest as a playwright. His three stage plays Brown Bitter, Wet Nellies, and Scouse have been performed at the Everyman Theatre. (In case you''re curious, "scouse" is a slang term for someone from Liverpool, named after the cheap, nearly meatless stew that is a staple in the traditional Liverpool working man''s diet.) One child actor in the three stage plays was a young talent named Craig Charles, who later grew up to become one of the stars of the hit British comedy, Red Dwarf. \r\n\r\nMr. Jacques wrote Redwall for the children at the Royal Wavertree School for the Blind in Liverpool, where as a truck driver, he delivered milk. His style of writing is very descriptive, because of the nature of his first audience, for whom he painted pictures with words, so that they could see them in their imaginations. (He remains a patron of the school.)\r\n\r\nHis writing gained acclaim when Alan Durband, his childhood English teacher, read Redwall, and showed it to a publisher without telling Brian. This event led to a contract for the first five books in the Redwall series. (If you look, you''ll find a dedication to Alan in the front of The Bellmaker.)\r\n\r\nHe now hosts his own weekly radio show, Jakestown, on BBC Radio Merseyside. It airs Sunday afternoons on 95.8 FM in Liverpool, where Brian shares his comedy and wit, and plays his favourites from the world of opera. (He is a veritable expert on The Three Tenors.)\r\n\r\nHe has two grown sons, both who live in Liverpool. Marc (32) is a builder, a carpenter, and a bricklayer. David (34) is a professor of Art, and a muralist. (He paints large murals in Children\\''s hospitals, soccer stadiums, and trade union offices as far away as Germany, Mexico, and Chile.) Brian wrote Mariel of Redwall in honour of his granddaughter, Jade, and dedicated The Great Redwall Feast to her. \r\n\r\nMr. Jacques enjoys walking his dog, "Teddy", a white West Highland Terrier, and completing crossword puzzles. When there''s time he reads the works of Mario Puzo, Damon Runyon, Richard Condon, Larry McMurtry, and P.G. Wodehouse.

I started out writing sci-fi epics (my Star Wars phase) then went on to swords and sorcery tales (my Dungeons and Dragons phase) and then, during the summer holiday when I was fourteen, started on a humorous story about a boy addicted to video games (written, of course, during my video game phase). It turned out to be quite a long story, really a short novel, and I rewrote it the next summer. We had a family friend who knew Roald Dahl - one of my favourite authors - and this friend offered to show Dahl my story. I was paralysed with excitement. I never heard back from Roald Dahl directly, but he read my story, and liked it enough to pass on to his own literary agent. I got a letter from them, saying they wanted to take me on, and try to sell my story. And they did. \r\n\r\nColin''s Fantastic Video Adventure was published in 1985, in Britain and the U.S, and later in France. It was easily the most exciting thing that had ever happened to me -- and it gave me the confidence to think I could make writing my career. \r\n\r\nI did my BA at the University of Toronto (a double major in cinema studies and English) and wrote my second children''s novel The Live-Forever Machine in my final year, for a creative writing course.

(166, 'Gerber', 'Squalling and pink, Michael Gerber was squirted into the world on June 14, 1969. Slightly premature, Mr. Gerber would''ve been less anxious to emerge had he realized that the Beatles were basically broken up already. Not only that, but he was in the Deep South, a region that has given him the creeps ever since. Though his parents could not do anything about the rift between John Lennon and Paul McCartney, they did move him to St. Louis, Missouri (which is still kinda Southern, but only enough to make you appreciate how it''s not). It was here, in this beer and baseball-crazed town of big people, that Mr. Gerber spent the majority of his childhood. \r\n\r\nMr. Gerber quickly realized that he was a small person--a child--and he had better make the big people like him if he wanted to survive. This impulse first manifested itself in impromptu standup routines for his family, and for several years just the sight of the strangely professorial child with dirty glasses saying things like "Nixon blows" was more than enough to keep everyone chuckling. Remember, this was the Seventies, and people smoked a lot of non-medicinal marijuana.\r\n\r\nOnce Mr. Gerber donned big boy pants, however, he found that his peers were a tougher audience. But they were roughly the same size as he was, so who gave a damn what they thought? The big person in the room was the teacher, and Mr. Gerber instinctively knew that good grades, not Nixon jokes, were the way to a teacher''s heart. Comedy went into the closet, and for the next decade, Mr. Gerber was perhaps the grayest, most serious child ever to skulk about the American Midwest. If there had been anti-talent shows, Mr. Gerber would''ve won them.\r\n\r\nBut there are some times of life too ridiculous to take seriously, and adolescence is definitely one of these. Inspired by writers like James Thurber and Robert Benchley, Mr. Gerber began filling spiral-bound notebooks full of stories and jokes. Eventually this led to a column in his high school newspaper, and eventually that led to admission to Yale University.\r\n\r\nLocated in New Haven, Connecticut, Yale would like you to know that it is one of America''s most prestigious colleges. For over three hundred years, its students have been exhorted to save the world, and God knows they try, but the world just seems to get more and more screwed up. As a History major, Mr. Gerber learned this immediately. A believer in the Hippocratic Oath--"first, do no harm"-comedy seemed like a career unlikely to make things worse. He wrote a humor column for the student weekly, The Yale Herald, then went on to resurrect the University''s ancient Yale Record college humor magazine.\r\n\r\nThe Record gave Gerber a chance to ignore all the wonderful educational opportunities that Yale has to offer, in favor of scurrying around campus late at night looking for a picture of Hitler to Xerox and paste on to the body of a fat, naked woman. Not content with wasting his own education, Gerber was able to convince several others to waste their time and tuition as well. As a result of their efforts, The Record continues to ruin lives today.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating in 1991, Gerber attempted to start a national college humor magazine. That didn''t work. Then he tried to get a job as a magazine editor in New York. That didnít work, either. He moved to Seattle for a year, and that worked, but only because he didn''t try to do anything but play gin rummy with his best friend from high school. He temped, and also wrote a not-particularly-loved humor column for Seattle Weekly.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, Mr. Gerber moved back to New York, for another futile run at the big time. Not content to immolate his own career, he convinced a college friend, Jonathan Schwarz, to share in the failure as his writing partner. The next five years were spent on the edge of starvation, selling humor pieces to The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly, Esquire, and many other publications. Mr. Gerber and Mr. Schwarz contributed material to PBS, NPR, and "Saturday Night Live," and created a parody of The Wall Street Journal, which could not be distributed because the newsstand business is all mobbed up. About the best thing that can be said for that time in Mr. Gerberís life is: he got a cat.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Mr. Gerber finally said "the hell with it," and moved back to Chicago, where he had gone to high school. After a few more unsuccessful attempts at careers--advertising and children''s magazines--Mr. Gerber worked nights writing a book-length parody of Harry Potter. His miserable track record made Mr. Gerber doubt that anyone would publish it, but despite it all, he still enjoyed writing jokes. Even though parody is protected by the U.S. Constitution, many publishers passed on the manuscript, fearing a lawsuit from Warner Bros. About to get married and with nothing to lose except a completely unwarranted optimism, Mr. Gerber self-published Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody in December 2001. This book was published in the UK as Barry Trotter and the Shameless Parody, and that one-word change was apparently powerful enough to keep it on the bestseller lists for six months.\r\n\r\nThree years--and 700,000 copies--later, Barry Trotter has spawned two sequels (Barry Trotter and the Unnecessary Sequel in 2003, and Barry Trotter and the Dead Horse in 2004). The series has been translated into nearly twenty different languages, proving beyond a doubt that fart jokes are universal. With financial success has come several new pairs of pants, a Rickenbacker guitar, and many, many used books. Not content to leave well enough alone, Mr. Gerber is working on two new parodies and a comic novel, all of which he hopes will appear in the next year or two.

SORCERY RISING is her first solo novel. It will be followed by WILD MAGIC and THE WARS OF SORCERY.\r\n\r\nBorn in Cornwall, Jane was educated at Liskeard Grammar School and then took an English degree at Goldsmiths'' College, University of London, where -- inspired by Tolkien -- she specialised in Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse, after which she qualified as a lecturer in English and Drama and taught the latter at North London College for a year. She then decided to follow up her fascination with old Nordic language, history and literature by taking a Master''s degree in Scandinavian Studies at University College, a course that specialised in the reading and translation of Old Icelandic sagas. Now entirely over-qualified and apparently unemployable, she was blessed by a remarkable working of fate: one day in the street she got talking to a neighbour who announced she was leaving her job. When asked where she worked, she replied, &quot;George Allen &amp; Unwin Publishers&quot;: magic words, since this was Tolkien''s publisher. Advised to apply for the secretarial job the neighour was vacating (despite having no qualifications, or aptitude for secretarial work) Jane found herself, a week later, working on the Tolkien list and on Unwin''s incipient fantasy list. Within six months she had been promoted to Editor.\r\n\r\nDuring her time at Unwins, she was responsible for commissioning both John Howe and Alan Lee to illustrate Tolkien''s works -- on book covers and in calendars, and also brought the work of Ted Nasmith to the public for the first time.

Possessed of a ''terrifying energy'' (as her colleagues and friends term it), Jane has never been satisfied with a life spent behind a desk: when not working she is often to be found on cliffs and rockfaces all over the world; failing that, in whatever rock-climbing gym may be at hand. Taught to climb by ex-partner, Mike Harrison and the lads in the Holmfirth climbing team, she continued her obsession with the sport even after the pair split up and has climbed in Norway, New Zealand, Spain, the Channel Islands, France and the USA. She professes herself to be never happier than when poised halfway up a granite seacliff in the sun, looking down on the backs of herring gulls and jackdaws as they slide through the air below her -- as long as she has a well-placed camming device not too far away.\r\n\r\nOther enthusiasms include watching football; esoterica, world music, wild places, animals of all sorts, but especially cats; and going to the movies.\r\n\r\nShe also loves to travel. Favourite places include the Markar River, Bergï¿½orshvoll and ï¿½ingvellir in Iceland; Joshua Tree, Tuolomne Meadows and the Yosemite Valley; Avebury, West Pembroke and the Peak District of England; South Island, New Zealand; and the limestone cliffs of southern Spain.

The family moved around a lot, finally settling in rural Essex. As children, Diana and her two sisters were deprived of a good, steady supply of books by a father, ï¿½who could beat Scrooge in a meanness contestï¿½. So, armed with a vivid imagination and an insatiable quest for good books to read, she decided that she would have to write them herself.\r\n\r\nShe was extremely dyslexic, so when she told her parents she wanted to be a writer, they just laughed. However between ages of 12 and 14, the young writer completed two epic tales scrawled in a total of 20 copy books. This taught her from an early age the invaluable lesson of how to finish a book.\r\n\r\nHer higher education began in 1953 when she went up to St Anneï¿½s College Oxford, and attended lectures by CS Lewis and JRR Tolkein. It was here she met her husband, John A Burrow, who is Professor of English at Bristol University. They married in 1956 and have three sons.\r\n\r\nShe has written both childrenï¿½s books and plays (mostly performed at the London Arts Theatre) and her first book was published in 1973. Since then she has written over 40 books. Her enviably fertile mind has allowed her to write prolifically, even when her three boys were small, and quite a handful! When writing, she is totally absorbed in the book and on one never-to-be forgotten occasion, her sons returned from school ravenous to find she had shoved a pair of muddy shoes in the oven for their tea! She says, ï¿½I am an inspirational writer. I forget meals and write with ever-increasing speed.ï¿½\r\n\r\nDiana Wynne Jones first conjured up the enigmatic and embroidered dressing-gowned enchanter Chrestomanci in 1977.

Christopher''s love for the magic of stories led him to craft a novel that he would enjoy reading. The project began as a hobby; he never intended to be published. He took a month to plot out the entire trilogy, then sat on the sofa and began writing in a notebook. When he reached sixty pages, he gained enough confidence to transfer the work to his computer, where most of Eragon was written, although he sometimes found that the story flowed better when he wrote by hand. All the characters in Eragon are from Christopher''s imagination except Angela the herbalist, who is loosely based on his sister.\r\n\r\nIt took him a year to write the first draft of Eragon. He took a second year to revise the book and then gave it to his parents to read. The family decided to self-publish the book and so a third year was spent with another round of edits, designing a cover, typesetting the manuscript, and creating marketing materials. During this time Christopher drew the map for Eragon, as well as the dragon eye that appears inside the hardcover edition. Finally, the manuscript was sent to press, and the first books arrived.\r\n\r\nThe Paolini family spent the next year promoting the book themselves. Beginning with talks at the local library and high school, they then traveled across the U.S. Christopher gave over 135 presentations at libraries, bookstores, and schools in 2002 and early 2003. He did most of the events dressed in a medieval costume of red shirt, billowy black pants, lace-up boots, and a jaunty black cap.\r\n\r\nIn summer 2002, author Carl Hiaasen, whose stepson had bought and read a copy of the self-published book while on vacation in Montana, brought Eragon to the attention of his publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, who subsequently acquired the rights to publish Eragon and the rest of the Inheritance trilogy.\r\n\r\nWhen the trilogy is completed, Christopher plans to take a long vacation, when he will ponder which of his many story ideas he will write next.\r\n\r\n', 1, 547, 1, '', 'Christopher'),

He tends to keep his personal life to himself, but he has made allusions to being a lonely and bitter child who found a release of a sort in science fiction and fantasy.\r\n\r\nIn 1949 he started a science fiction fanzine called Spaceship and made his first professional sale to Science Fiction Adventures, a non-fiction piece called &quot;Fanmag,&quot; in the December 1953 issue. His first professional fiction publication was &quot;Gorgon Planet&quot; in the February 1954 issue of the British magazine Nebula Science Fiction. His first novel, Revolt on Alpha C, was published in 1955.\r\n\r\nIn 1956 he graduated from Columbia University, having majored in Comparative Literature, and married Barbara Brown, an &quot;electronics engineer specializing in radar and optics&quot; (according to a dust-jacket bio). His literary background would surface eventually in his writing, but for a time, he seems to have kept the &quot;straight&quot; separate from the science fiction he wrote, as it was pure adventure stuff with little that would indicate interests beyond the typical science fiction of the day\r\n', 1, 547, 1, '', 'Robert'),

(280, 'Wurts', 'Janny Wurts is the author of Traitor''s Knot and To Ride Hell''s Chasm and twelve other novels, a short story collection, as well as the internationally best selling Empire trilogy, co authored with Raymond E. Feist. Her most recent title in the Wars of Light and Shadow series, Traitor''s Knot, culminates more than twenty years of carefully evolved ideas. The cover images on the books, both in the US and abroad, are her own paintings, depicting her vision of characters and setting.\r\n\r\nThrough her combined talents as a writer/illustrator, Janny has immersed herself in a lifelong ambition: to create a seamless interface between words and pictures that will lead reader and viewer into the imagination. Her lavish use of language invites the mind into a crafted realm of experience, with characters and events woven into a complex tapestry, and drawn with an intensity to inspire active fuel for thought. Her research includes a range of direct experience, lending her fantasy a gritty realism, and her scenes involving magic crafted with intricate continuity. A self-taught painter, she draws directly from the imagination, creating scenes in a representational style that blurs the edges between dream and reality. She makes few preliminary sketches, but envisions her characters and the scenes that contain them, then executes the final directly from the initial pencil drawing.\r\n\r\nThe seed idea for the Wars of Light and Shadow series occurred, when, in the course of researching tactic and weapons, she viewed a documentary film on the Battle of Culloden Moor. This was the first time she had encountered that historical context of that brutal event, with the embroidery of romance stripped from it. The experience gave rise to an awakening, which became anger, that so often, our education, literature and entertainment slant history in a manner that equates winners and losers with moral right and wrong, and the prevalent attitude, that killing wars can be seen as justifiable solutions when only one side of the picture is presented.\r\n\r\nHer series takes the stance that there are two sides to every question, and follows two characters who are half brothers. One a bard trained as a master of magecraft, and the other a born ruler with a charismatic passion for justice, have become cursed to lifelong enmity. As one sibling raises a devoted mass following, the other tries desperately to stave off defeat through solitary discipline and cleverness. The conflict sweeps across an imaginary world, dividing land and people through an intricate play of politics and the inborn prejudices of polarized factions already set at odds. Readers are led on a journey that embraces both viewpoints. The story explores the ironies of morality which often confound our own human condition - that what appears right and just, by one side, becomes reprehensible when seen from the opposite angle. What is apparently good for the many, too often causes devastating suffering to the nonconformist minority. Through the interactions between the characters themselves, the reader is left to their own discretion to interpret the moral impact of events.\r\n\r\nSays Janny of her work, &quot;I chose to frame this story against a backdrop of fantasy because I could handle even the most sensitive issues with the gloves off - explore the myriad angles of our troubled times with the least risk of offending anyone''s personal sensibilities. The result, I can hope, is an expanding journey of the spirit that explores the grand depths, and rises to the challenge of mapping the ethereal potential of an evolving planetary consciousness... explore free thought and compassionate understanding.&quot;\r\n\r\nBeyond writing, Janny''s award winning paintings have been showcased in exhibitions of imaginative artwork, among them a commemorative exhibition for NASA''s 25th Anniversary; the Art of the Cosmos at Hayden Planetarium in New York; and two exhibits of fantasy art, at both the Delaware Art Museum, and Canton Art Museum.\r\n \r\n \r\n', 1, 547, 1, '', 'Janny'),

I used to wonder how that happened. I used to say ï¿½I love science fiction, but I hate science. I know nothing about science.ï¿½ Then, the truth came to me. What I actually hate is physics, which bores me to tears. On the other hand, I love biology, sociology, psychology, socio-biology, anthropology, archeology and planetology, and will cheerfully delve into any and all of them for hours, if not days, at a time. And, as Iï¿½ve found, I will equally cheerfully write about them. \r\n\r\nFantasy is opening up new vistas for me, or perhaps I should say it is returning me to old vistas. I have been reading folklore and fairy tales for as long as I have been able to read. It has long been my dream to take the raw magic found in these ancient stories and span them into something new. Like the stories we tell about our future and our technology, the stories we tell about our past and our magic are powerful and delightful. They give us another look at what makes is human.

When the White Wizards of Chaos threaten the area of the world to which the Order-based Dorrin has been exiled to "find himself," he uses his engineering talents to design and build weaponry and his dreamed-of machines. Modesitt''s prose lacks the range to make his rather pedestrian narrative interesting: more than a few events are unnecessarily telegraphed to readers several chapters before they happen, and the same character often--irritatingly--described three different ways within a few paragraphs.

Sometime well after the events in The Magic Engineer and before The Magic of Recluce, order engineer Justen, a junior in his guild, volunteers for a force sent by Recluce to aid the matriarchy of Sarronnyn, under attack by the White Wizards of Fairhaven in their move to extend the rule of chaos. The vastly outnumbered armies of order nearly succeed in holding back the conquerors, mostly due to Justen''s development of chaos-destroying weapons and the efforts of his brother Gunnar, a powerful Air Wizard who marshals the weather as a formidable weapon and unleashes flash floods. But treason fells the defenders, and Justen is separated from his cohorts and ends up wandering in the deserts of Candar. Rescued by the druid Dayala, he is taken to her people in Naclos, where he learns about living in perfect harmony with nature, and about his fearsome destiny to curtail the savage war between order and chaos. Although at times his villains seem a touch unsophisticated and even simpleminded for the evil they perpetrate, Modesitt creates a deeper and more intricate world with each volume.\r\nCopyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.', 'January 1995', 11, '', '0-812-53404-2', 11, 62, 4, '2003-04-09 21:38:24', '2003-04-11 15:17:14', 1, 'English', 'Paperback'),
(165, 'Death of Chaos, The', 'From Publishers Weekly\r\nModesitt''s entertaining fifth book in the Recluce fantasy series details the further adventures of the young wizard Lerris, protagonist of the 1991 series kickoff, The Magic of Recluce. Lerris, who narrates, is happily ensconsed in his carpentry shop and contentedly married to Krystal, a military leader, when he is called to employ his magical powers in battle against the forces of Hamor, an empire across the ocean. The stakes are bigger than simple national interest: in the Recluce universe, chaos and order must be balanced; if either disappears or dies, the world will be destroyed. This novel appeals not primarily for its grand fantasy themes, though, but for Modesitt''s convincing treatment of the relationship between Lerris and Krystal?whose fear for, and envy of, her husband manifests as anger. Similarly, Lerris''s confusion about why he is driven to heroism comes through clearly and convincingly. The cosmic conflict that fuels the story line is resolved by a deus ex machina, and those not familiar with the earlier series books may find some plot twists hard to follow. Modesitt''s dialogue and, above all, character development have improved from earlier volumes, however, resulting in a fantasy whose roots are dug into the reality of human nature.\r\nCopyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.', 'September 1995', 11, '', '0-812-54824-8', 11, 62, 4, '2003-04-09 21:39:45', '2003-04-11 15:17:43', 1, 'English', 'Paperback'),
(166, 'Fall of Angels', 'From Publishers Weekly\r\nThe Gods themselves do battle in this prequel to Modesitt''s popular Recluse saga. Set centuries before last year''s The Death of Chaos, the story recounts a space battle in which the frigate Winterlance is blown into another universe and makes an emergency landing on a habitable planet. The castaways, mostly female space marines, initially must struggle with the harsh weather and their own failing technology in order to survive. Soon, however, they discover that they share their new world with a more intelligent enemy: other humans. The natives, whose culture is intensely patriarchal, have magical powers and are extremely hostile, especially to independent women. As Ryba and Nylan, the Winterlance''s former chief officers, struggle to create both a civilization and a means to defend it, they must fight increasingly difficult battles even while coming to terms with their own awakening magical powers. Modesitt''s character development is solid, and the novel makes intriguing use of technology in a fantasy setting, but the plot is predictable and the language pedestrian. A seemingly superfluous subplot concerning the chief villain''s home life fails to add excitement. Fans of the series should enjoy this sixth entry, particularly for its explication of the myths and legends of latter-day Recluse, but it''s not the sort of volume likely to win Modesitt a new legion of admirers.\r\nCopyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.', 'June 1996', 11, '', '0-812-53895-1', 11, 62, 4, '2003-04-09 21:41:01', '2003-04-11 15:18:23', 1, 'English', 'Paperback'),

(168, 'White Order, The', ' Amazon.com\r\nIn this author''s popular Recluce fantasies--beginning with The Magic of Recluce--the classic theme of youngsters growing to adult power and responsibility is repeatedly retold in terms of magic skill. Past books focused on the apparent good guys--"black" magicians who use order-magic (cooling, healing, strengthening) and constantly oppose the White Order of chaos wizards whose talent is fire and dissolution. Young hero Cerryl has a natural bent for chaos, and for him the Whites offer the only game in town. Painfully, he learns about balance: order-magic can be deviously used for destruction, chaos can cleanse and anyway requires order-control if it''s not to destroy the user. This moves interestingly away from simplistic "black is good, white is bad" magical color-coding ... but although Cerryl is a decent, ethical white wizard, the Order remains unpleasantly tyrannical--for example, an instant life sentence of slave labor for the equivalent of expired license plates. The magic training is interesting if repetitive (apprentices practice firebolts by zapping blockages in the public sewers), but Modesitt''s real story lies in waiting for Cerryl to become a full mage of the Order and perhaps confront its injustices in the massive sequel, Colors of Chaos. --David Langford, Amazon.co.uk', 'May 1998', 11, '', '0-812-54171-5', 11, 62, 4, '2003-04-09 21:43:07', '2003-04-11 15:19:44', 1, 'English', 'Paperback'),
